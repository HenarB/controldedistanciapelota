    ##-- Ball & Beam control using Simulink-Arduino --##

This files are intended to be used for educational purpuse

* Arduino code for the IR distance sensor
* Simulink blocks for modeling:
   * S-function model
   * Predefined blocks model
* 3D STL files
* Drawings

The goal of this project is to stabilize a ball on a beam at the desired distance 
with a PID controller.
Arduino code is implemented in a Simulink model by using a custom s-function builder block. 
 
##-- Requirements --##
To run this, you'll need:
	* Arduino, v. 1.8.5 or higher
	* MATLAB v. 2018a or higher, the Arduino toolbox add-on needs to be installed
